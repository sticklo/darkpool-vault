## What is DarkPool?

DCA alone is boring. DCA with friends competing on consistency? That's sticky.

DarkPool brings automated cbBTC investing directly into Farcaster. Deposit USDC anytime. Every week (v1), the vault automatically swaps to cbBTC. Friends see your consistency. You earn badges for streaks. This is how we make crypto investing social.


---

## The Problem

Crypto investing is isolated:
- Set up DCA on an exchange
- It runs in the background
- You forget about it
- Prices dump, you panic and stop
- No accountability, no social proof

Traditional DCA tools have automation but zero social features. Farcaster has social but no serious investing tools.

---

## The Solution

**DarkPool = Automated DCA + Social Accountability + Embedded Distribution**

- Deposit USDC directly from your Farcaster feed
- Vault pools funds transparently on Base
- In v1, automatic weekly cbBTC purchases
- In v2, compete with friends on consistency streaks
- In v3, one-tap gasless deposits

---

## How It Works

1. See DarkPool in your Farcaster feed
2. Tap to open Mini App
3. Connect wallet (MetaMask or Coinbase)
4. Deposit USDC to pooled vault
5. (v1) Vault auto-swaps to cbBTC every Sunday
6. (v2) Earn badges, compete on leaderboards
7. (v3) All gasless, truly one-tap

## Competitors

**Automated DCA exists** (Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Deltabadger) but it's:
- Centralized or isolated
- No social features
- Separate websites you forget to visit

**Farcaster has social** (tipping bots, NFT mints, games) but:
- No serious long-term investing tools
- Mostly speculation or one-off actions

**DarkPool is the only platform combining all three:**
- Automated DCA (proven strategy)
- Social accountability (increases retention)
- Embedded in feed (reduces friction)

## Built For

**Base Batches 002: Builder Track**

Built and deployed in 4 days using modern development workflows (Cursor + Claude AI).
